# 2026 A-Share Strategy Deep Report: Seeking Gems in the Trough, Lurking for Dawn

**Report Date:** January 2, 2026
**Analyst:** AI Research Expert
**Key Views:** The A-share market in 2026 is at a critical transition point from valuation restoration to performance-driven growth. With ROE bottoming out and rebounding, sustained inflows of long-term capital, and hard constraints from policies on "market capitalization management," the market presents distinct structural opportunities. Current allocation should focus on "deep value restoration," transformation targets where "old trees sprout new buds," and "oversold blue-chip leaders." By trading time for space, we aim to capture the potential Davis Double Play in mid-2026.

## 1. Macro Background and Reconfirmation of Market Bottom

### 1.1 ROE Cycle and Profit Inflection Point
The A-share market is currently at a critical turning point in the earnings cycle. Data shows that the overall ROE of A-shares (excluding financials) entered a downward cycle in Q2 2021. After four years of clearing, **2025 has entered a clear bottom range**.

*   **2026 Outlook:** 2026 is expected to be a pivotal year for ROE to bottom out and rebound. Market momentum will shift from simple valuation expansion to a state of "simultaneous rise in both performance and valuation." Although brokerages have diverging expectations for full A-share profit growth (CICC expects approx. 4.7%, while the composite market expectation is around 12%), the consensus in direction provides a safety cushion for the equity market.
*   **Household Allocation Potential:** The ratio of household deposits to stock market capitalization remains at historical average levels, leaving significant room compared to the previous two major bull markets. With risk-free interest rates declining, the trend of household wealth migrating into the stock market has not ended, providing the market with expectations for a continuous stream of incremental funds.

### 1.2 Valuation Differentiation and Low-Valuation Characteristics
Although the valuations of the Shanghai Composite Index (PE-TTM 14.1x, 77.6th percentile) and CSI 300 (PE-TTM 13.2x, 80.3rd percentile) no longer appear absolutely cheap, there are significant valuation troughs structurally:

*   **Extremely Underweight Sectors:** Food & Beverage PE-TTM is only 20.82x (7.72nd percentile), Non-banking Financials PE-TTM is 11.39x (1.52nd percentile), and Construction & Decoration PE-TTM is 9.26x. The valuation percentiles of these sectors are at historically extremely low levels, seriously diverging from their fundamental status.
*   **Status of Below-Net-Asset Stocks:** As of the close on September 11, 2025, there were only 293 A-share stocks trading below net asset value (PB<1), accounting for 5.39% of all A-share companies. This is a significant reduction from the 836 stocks at the launch of the "924 Market Rally" on September 24, 2024. This indicates that the first round of valuation restoration is basically complete. The remaining 293 stocks are mostly "hard nuts" or undiscovered gems, among which **long-term below-net-asset stocks with excellent performance are worth deep excavation**.

## 2. Core Strategy 1: "Below-Net-Asset Restoration" and Dividend Revaluation Driven by Policy

**Logic Mainline:** The CSRC's *Guideline No. 10 on Supervision of Listed Companies—Market Capitalization Management* is the most important policy variable for 2026 investment. This guideline mandatorily requires companies trading below net asset value for a long period to disclose valuation enhancement plans, providing a strong policy floor for low-valuation sectors.

### 2.1 Banking Sector: Not Just Defense, But Valuation Regression
*   **Status:** The banking sector is a hard-hit area for long-term below-net-asset trading, with about 90% of 42 companies trading below book value for a long time. In the 2025 market trend, state-owned large banks performed excellently, while joint-stock banks performed mediocrely.
*   **Opportunities:**
    *   **National Team Endorsement:** China Construction Bank, Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China are heavily held by Central Huijin and China Securities Finance Corporation (holding values all exceeding 1 trillion yuan).
    *   **Catch-up of Joint-Stock Banks:** Compared to Agricultural Bank's +57% and ICBC's +20% gains, Ping An Bank rose only slightly by 2.25% in 2025 (TTM PE 5.1x). With the transmission of pressure from market capitalization management assessments, low-valuation joint-stock banks have strong motivation to boost stock prices through buybacks, shareholdings, or dividends, with an expected restoration space of 20%-35%.
    *   **Northbound Capital Trends:** In the first half of 2025, northbound funds increased their holdings in joint-stock banks (+21.308 billion yuan), with China Merchants Bank receiving an addition of 12.8 billion yuan, indicating that foreign capital's recognition of the asset quality of domestic banks is improving.

### 2.2 High-Dividend "Oversold" Assets
*   **Screening Criteria:** PB<1, positive net profit and growth rate in H1 2024, and a consensus forecast by 3+ institutions that net profit growth will exceed 20% for the next 3 years.
*   **Key Targets of Interest:**
    *   **Tongkun Co., Ltd.:** H1 2024 attributable net profit was 1.065 billion yuan, a year-on-year surge of 911.35%. Current PE is 14.97x, PB is only 0.72x. As a leader in polyester filament, it benefits from the improvement in industry supply and demand and possesses high earnings elasticity.
    *   **Billion Industrial Co., Ltd.:** PB 0.87, dividend yield as high as 7.48%. In a low-interest-rate environment, targets with both "dividend + growth" attributes are extremely attractive.
    *   **Runbon Stock, Hengyi Petrochemical, Bomesc:** All belong to the petrochemical or chemical fields, with predicted average performance growth leading the pack in the next 3 years, and are in a state of deep below-net-asset trading.

### 2.3 Infrastructure and Construction & Decoration
*   About 40% of the companies in this sector trade below net asset value for a long time. With the acceleration of special bond issuance and the deepening of the "China Special Valuation" logic, the valuation restoration of central construction enterprises is underway. Especially for leading companies actively deploying overseas business and participating in the "Belt and Road" construction, they are expected to open new growth spaces through "going global."

## 3. Core Strategy 2: "Old Trees Sprouting New Buds"—Valuation Reshaping of Traditional Industries

**Logic Mainline:** This is the most explosive strategy. Traditional low-valuation companies achieve a logic switch from "value stocks" to "growth stocks" by cutting into emerging tracks (humanoid robots, AI healthcare, intelligent driving).

### 3.1 Cross-Border Leap of Chemical New Materials
*   **Dongyue Group (0189.HK/A-share related target):** E Fund increased its stake in this stock in March 2025. As a traditional chemical enterprise, the cost of its PTFE material is only 1/3 of PEEK material, and it is seen as an important alternative material for key components of humanoid robots. This logic of "cost advantage + new track demand" is a model for the valuation re-estimation of chemical stocks.
*   **Jujie Microfiber:** Originally engaged in textile fibers, it has now transformed to develop electronic skin for humanoid robots. Intensive research by leading public funds (Yinhua, Dacheng, etc.) foreshadows the approach of technological breakthroughs. Once products land, valuation will shift from textile industry levels to technology industry levels.

### 3.2 Intelligent Upgrading of Manufacturing
*   **Dongya Machinery:** Transforming from an air compressor/compression molding machine manufacturer to cutting into the industrial robot robotic arm field. Traditional business provides stable cash flow, while new business provides valuation elasticity.
*   **Glodon:** A leader in construction software deeply transforming towards AI technology. Using AI to reconstruct architectural design and cost management, it is expected to see significant improvements in SaaS conversion rates and average revenue per user (ARPU) in 2026.

### 3.3 High-End Transformation of Steel
*   **Valin Steel:** A traditional steel cyclical stock, but it has successfully obtained certification from electric vehicle manufacturers to cut into the automotive sheet supply chain. This logic of "bypassing new energy" allows it to break free from pure dependence on the real estate cycle. Currently, about 40% of the steel sector trades below net asset value; Valin Steel's transformation gives it the potential for excess returns.

## 4. Core Strategy 3: Pro-Cyclical Recovery and Davis Double Play of "Oversold" White Horses

**Logic Mainline:** The five top brokerages (CITIC, CICC, Huatai, Guotai Junan, Haitong) are unanimously optimistic about the catch-up opportunities of pro-cyclical sectors in 2026. After three years of de-capacity, chemicals, breeding, non-ferrous metals, and building materials are expected to take the relay baton from the technology mainline.

### 4.1 Oversold Consumer Goods Leaders
In 2025, some consumer leaders saw significant declines due to market style rotation or short-term performance fluctuations, but fundamentals remain strong, offering high allocation value:

*   **Tsingtao Brewery:** Fell 21.1% in 2025. Revenue in the first three quarters was 29.4 billion yuan (up 1.4%), and attributable net profit was 5.274 billion yuan (up 5.7%). Current valuation has fallen back to historical lows. As the beer leader with the most certain high-end trend, it is expected to have 15%-25% upside room as consumption recovers.
*   **Aima Technology:** Fell 26% in 2025. Revenue in the first three quarters was 21.093 billion yuan (up 20.8%), and attributable net profit was 1.907 billion yuan (up 22.8%). The sharp contrast between high performance growth and stock price drop is a typical "oversold" scenario. Driven by the replacement demand for two-wheeled vehicles, it has a rebound potential of over 25%.

### 4.2 Bottoming of Logistics and Chemical Cycles
*   **SF Holding:** Fell 5% in 2025, dynamic PE 17.4x. Spent 1.542 billion yuan on share buybacks during the year. As a core asset of logistics services for Chinese brands going global, SF benefits not only from domestic e-commerce recovery but also from the high growth of cross-border e-commerce. With the release of capacity at Ezhou Huahu Airport, profit elasticity in 2026 can be expected.
*   **Wanhua Chemical:** Fell for four consecutive years, with net profit down 17.5% in the first three quarters of 2025. As the global leader in MDI, its cyclical bottom characteristics are obvious. Expectations for a warming in global chemical demand in 2026 are strong, and Wanhua, as a pro-cyclical leader, possesses strong alpha attributes.

### 4.3 The "Largest Expectation Gap" in the Real Estate Chain
*   Huatai Securities points out that the real estate chain is currently the field with the "largest expectation gap," expecting bottoming and stabilization in mid-2026.
*   **Focus:** Although the PE-TTM of the real estate sector seems not low at 23.38x, the PB is only 0.83x (16.92nd percentile). Focus on high-quality real estate companies and upstream building material leaders (e.g., leaders in waterproofing and pipe materials) that survived the industry winter and significantly increased market share.

## 5. Core Strategy 4: China's Advantage Manufacturing and Going Global "New Blue Chips"

**Logic Mainline:** Qiu Xiang from CITIC Securities proposes that "A-shares have transformed from an emerging market to a mature market, and listed companies are transforming from local enterprises to multinational companies." During the "15th Five-Year Plan," the going global of Chinese enterprises will be the main source of fundamental resilience.

### 5.1 The Three Musketeers of Going Global: Construction Machinery, Power Equipment, Commercial Buses
*   **Logic:** In November 2025, China's exports hit a record high of $1 trillion surplus. Accompanying RMB appreciation and cross-border capital return flows, companies with global pricing power will enjoy a valuation premium.
*   **Target Characteristics:** These companies not only have fast profit growth (expected profit growth for power equipment is 64.63%) but can also smooth domestic cycle fluctuations through overseas sales.
*   **Key Focus:** Excavator and loader leaders (global market share No. 1); leaders in photovoltaic inverters and wind power complete machines; Yutong Bus, etc.

### 5.2 Medical Devices and Home Appliances
*   Medical devices combine both "safe assets" and "AI carrier" attributes. As the penetration of Chinese medical equipment in developing country markets increases, relevant leaders are expected to replicate the performance of Japanese medical device enterprises during their globalization process.
*   Home Appliance Sector: Although northbound funds have slightly decreased their holdings in home appliances (-13%), as one of the most successful sectors in going global, it offers stable cash flow and high dividend rates, making it an important allocation direction for dividend assets.

## 6. 2026 Trading Rhythm and Style Rotation Outlook

### 6.1 Style Switching Timeline
*   **Spring Rally to Mid-2026 (Transition from Bull Market 1.0 to 2.0):** Shenwan Hongyuan points out that high-dividend defensive strategies may dominate in this phase. Attention is suggested on low-valuation value directions such as home appliances, special steel, and non-banking financials.
*   **Mid-2026 (Around June):** The watershed for style rotation. Soochow Securities judges that if PPI turns positive later than expected, market style will switch further to dividend assets, and the cost-performance of the dividend style will highlight again.
*   **Second Half of the Year:** As the real estate chain stabilizes and the global interest rate cut cycle begins, the growth style (especially AI applications, humanoid robot industrial chains) may regain the main line status.

### 6.2 Insights from Capital Behavior
*   **Northbound Funds:** Continuously increased positions in the first half of 2025, with holding market value increasing by 87.1 billion yuan. Its strategy has undergone a major structural adjustment—shifting from high-valuation core assets (decreased holdings in liquor) to low-valuation "old economy" (banking, non-ferrous, transportation, utilities). This implies the main tone of "value return" for the 2026 market.
*   **Public Mutual Funds:** Leading institutions (Yinhua, Dacheng, Quanguo, Harvest, E Fund) are intensively researching traditional industry companies, indicating that institutional positions are migrating to traditional low-valuation sectors with "new logic."

3.  **Speculative Plays (10%-20%):** **Oversold White Horses and Pro-Cyclicals**.
    *   **Consumer:** Tsingtao Brewery, Aima Technology.
    *   **Real Estate Chain:** Focus on stage opportunities for high-quality building materials and central SOEs.
    *   **Non-Banking Financials:** Brokerages and insurance currently have extremely low valuations; if market trading becomes active, they possess high explosive power.

**Risk Warnings:**
*   Escalation of overseas geopolitical risks affecting the export logic.
*   Domestic economic recovery strength is less than expected, leading to delayed ROE repair.
*   Acceleration of style switching causing excess corrections in growth stocks.

**Conclusion:**
2026 is a year of "mean reversion." Whether it is below-net-asset stocks strongly pushed by policy or traditional giants breaking through through technological innovation, they will be repriced in this year. As investors, we should discard impetuousness and embrace high-quality Chinese assets that are undervalued but undergoing positive changes.
